Overview
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline to classify customer support emails based on their content. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it analyses email bodies and predicts categories such as Login Issues, Billing Problems, or Technical Errors. This can help automate ticket routing and improve response efficiency.

🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymised support emails with the following columns:

Column	Description
Sender	Email address of the user
subject	Subject line of the support email
body	Full message content
sent_date	Timestamp of when the email was sent
For demonstration purposes, a simulated label column is added to represent the category of each email.
🧠 Features
Text Cleaning: Removes noise and normalises email content

TF-IDF Vectorisation: Converts text into numerical features

Naive Bayes Classification: Predicts email categories

Evaluation Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score
